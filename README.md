One script listens to the radio and writes the songs to a file, the other uploads the songs to a spotify playlist. 

Turn both scripts on and they will continuously upload new techno songs to a spotify playlist. 

You'd need to populate your own CLIENT_ID and SECRET_ID found in the developer dashboard for Spotify.

This code is entirely generated by AI, but required a lot of back-and-forth to work.
